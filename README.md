# messageparser
An easy to use message parsing/building library to build/parse fixed length, variable length, bitmap type fields.

Often, it happens that you are required to read/write a complex structured data with some fixed length or variable length fields.
The these fields might be conditional or mandatory in nature.
In such situations, instead of writing an adhoc data/message builder(writer)/parser(reader), you can use these apis written in golang.
